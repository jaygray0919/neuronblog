# Atrazine

[Atrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrazine) is a [herbicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide) of the [triazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triazine) class. 
It is used to prevent pre and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.

Atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides in the US. But it was banned in the European Union in 2004 because of persistent groundwater contamination. For example, there is no maximum residue limit [(MRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_residue_limit) in Codex Alimentarius [(CODEX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alimentarius)

In the United States as of 2018, Atrazine was the second most widely used herbicide after glyphosate, with 76 million pounds of it applied each year.

One [claim](https://schema.org/Claim) is that Atrazine improves crop yields. Its effect may boost yields from 1% to 6%, with 3% to 4% being the conclusion of an [economic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18085057/).

Let's look at atrazine data sources, as there are many folks who are interested. As you would expect, [PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2256) had **detail**. Here an interesting [3 dimensional view](https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/MXWJVTOOROXGIU-UHFFFAOYSA-N/twirl) of the Atrazine chemical. US FDA also [keeps track](https://fdasis.nlm.nih.gov/srs/unii/QJA9M5H4IM), as does [US EPA](
https://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/searchandretrieve/substancesearch/search.do?details=displayDetails&selectedSubstanceId=91913).

Now let's look at Atrazine properties. In [ChEFS](

-  Food Pesticide Chemicals with Regulated Residues on Food Commodities (IR-4)
   - and
-  Bioactive Capabilities
-  Chemical Category

Atrazine degrades in soil primarily by the action of microbes. Here are Atrazine-degradates identified in ChEFS:
-  [2-chloro-4-hydroxy-6-amino-1,3,5-triazine](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEFS_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:46158)
-  [4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-ol](
https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEFS_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:96700)
-  [Cyanuric acid](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEFS_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:96656)
-  [deisopropylatrazine](
https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEFS_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:48496&morelike=1)

Let's look at ChEMATIC for Atrazine properties and its degradates such as 6-deisopropylatrazine. [Atrazine](
https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_AG_02:38019067/facet_MC_24:73000001/facet_MD_03:68175238/facet_ME_01:51000013&group=facet_AG_01) is grouped by:
-  Interaction: Human Genes and Chemicals
   - and
-  Occupational Diseases
-  Heterocyclic Compounds
-  Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment

A closer look at [6-deisopropylatrazine](
https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_AG_01:39052448,39056525/facet_AG_02:38000151,38000492,38008416,38014417,38019795/facet_AG_04:36001098/facet_MD_03:68175238&morelike=1) shows the following chemical â€“ gene interaction:
-  6-deisopropylatrazine binds to ESR1 protein
-  6-deisopropylatrazine inhibits the reaction [Estradiol binds to and results in increased activity of ESR1 protein]
-  6-deisopropylatrazine results in decreased activity of PDE4A protein
